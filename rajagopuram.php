            <h2>Raja Gopuram</h2>
            <p>
                Construction of a new Rajagopuram for the temple, has been the long desire of the devotees of this temple. Hence it has been decided to construct a beautiful
and imposing Rajagopuram, with inspiring statues of the God's various forms. So our endeavour would be :
            <ol>
                    <li>to raise a befitting Rajagopuram</li>
                    <li>to raise the walls on all sides of the temple</li>
                    <li>to change the flooring with proper tiles</li>
                    <li> to conduct the Kumbabishekam</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
            Both the Mahasannidhanams of Sringeri Saradha Peetam, both the Acharyas of
            Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Sri Sri Omkarananda Swamigal of Bhuvaneswari Peetam and
            Sri Thukaram Ganapathy Maharaj, have showered their holy blessings for the successful
            completion of this great task. Further we believe with the divine power of the presiding deities of
            the temple, added with the dedicated cooperation of the devotees, that we will complete the task
            fully, remarkably, and in time.
            </p>

            <h4>Devotees Contributions</h4>
            <p>
            Above total holy task involves huge expenditure, needing several lakhs of Rupees. Only
devotees' liberal donations will make us achieve the great purpose, which will ultimately result in
ever pouring blessings from the Almighty.
Following are the major headings of the items of work for the raising of Rajagopuram, and
related works as above, and their respective cost. The devotees may individually or collectively
