                    and neivedyam are offered to the respective deity, and taken on procession in the evening accompanied by Bhajans of Sri Vittal Bhajan Mandali Bhagavathars. Veedi Ula (taking on
                    procession along the four streets around the Temple) on Sukla Chathurthi, Sukla Sashti and all Ekadasi Days, for the respective deity, is a regular event, amounting to more than
                    60 days in a year. Daily morning Prabodhanam and night Dolothsavam are must for Pandurangan, as in Pandaripuram. Laksharchanai to Vinayagar during Vinayaga

                    performed every year. Kanchi Maha Periyaval's Janma nakshatram (birth day) is devotedly celebrated with Maharudra japam etc. Aadi Krithigai is observed by the devotees by
                    taking Paal (milk) Kavadi to Lord Murugan. Ashada Ekadasi during Ashada month, Sarva Udhana Ekadasi during Karthigai month and Vaikunda Ekadasi, are so special to devotees
                    of Lord Pandurangan when they are allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum and have SPARSA DHARSAN (touching the lotus feet of the deity and praying). Devotees from all
                    over Chennai throng the temple throughout the day for this opportunity. During entire Margazhi month, early morning Veedi Bhajanai and special poojas are big attraction for
                    sevarthies. Sri Vittal Bhajan Mandali Bhagavathars, celebrate Abhang Sammelanam during last week of January every year. So also music lovers under Sapthaswaralaya
                    celebrate Annual day and St. Thyagaraja Aradhana festival, with musical extravaganza, during May-June every year, in this temple. The Samajam has committed for Anna
